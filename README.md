# Project Titanic
# Titanic Data Analysis

This repository explores the Titanic passenger dataset to predict passenger survival rates using machine learning techniques.

# Project Goals:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: to understand data type and structure, dealing with missing values, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
<br/>
Feature Engineering: Creating new feature using existing features to improve model performance.
<br/>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the key variables, identify correlations, and visualize the data.
<br/>
Modelling and Evaluation: Train and compare various machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
